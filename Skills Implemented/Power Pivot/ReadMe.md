## Power Pivot

-  I created a data model by integrating the `data_jobs_all` and `data_jobs_skills` tables into one model.
-  Since I had already cleaned the data using Power Query; Power Pivot created a relationship between these two tables.
- Then I created some measures that are used in answering Q3 and Q4 (and Q2).

#### ðŸ”— Data Model

- I created a relationship between my two tables using the `job_id` column.
